<h2>
    The future of The Daily Snail.
</h2>
<h3>
    With recent news from Juligz, sadly, the civilisation event will not be moving forwards. However, a new SMP will be released this Friday, the 8th (atleast, i THINK its the 8th...). This new SMP is titled; "Untitled Private SMP", though the "private" is silent. As a member of this SMP, I will be constructing a news station, and continuing both live, and written down news, in the form of livestreams/videos, and by utilising the Daily Snail as a general form of news. I will be running ads on people/their shops, or even general news that I deem worthy. <br><br> TLDR; Despite the civilisation event not going ahead, I will continue The Daily Snail over on the Untitled Private SMP (UPSMP).
