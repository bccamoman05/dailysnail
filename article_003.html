    First day on the Untitled SMP.
</h2>
<h3>
    Good morning/afternoon all readers. Today marks the first day of the Untitled SMP, which I (most likely) live streamed over on <u><a href=https://twitch.tv/officialbaconman>twitch.</a></u> As of writing this article, the beginning of the server has not occurred as of yet, however, this Saturday, the 8th of November, the server will begin. I intend to do live news updates throughout the day, and possibly even do a written article at the end of the day, summarising everything that happened. I will update this article the day of the event, with everyone's feelings and how people react to the beginning of the server. Stay tuned, and enjoy!
