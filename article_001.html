    The start of the Snail.

<h3>
    Hey there! This is The Daily Snail, a news website I've made, mostly to practice HTML and CSS skills, along with ugly things like PHP, but also for Juligz's upcoming Civilization event, where I intend to do some front-line, up close news. Frankly, I've always had a news interest, wanting to begin my own rival news station in the SIMPS SMP, but honestly, SIMPS has been dying for some time, so I never was bothered to, and didnt end up making the building for it. But now, with Juligz's event, I have a reason to make it, and I intend to do so. This website is still in its early stages, and I intend to add more features, like a working contact page, and more articles. But for now, this is what I've got. Enjoy!
